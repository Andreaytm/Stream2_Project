# Stream 2 Project - Campaign for DonorsChoose

## Overview

### About the DonorsChoose
*Please note this is a fictional scenario of producing a website to increase donations for DonorsChoose.
Dashboard information was randomly selected to produce a snapshot of the effects of donors donations on student lives.*
The website is a responsive with an interactive graphical dashboard on the education statistics of several
US States to highlight the impact and improvements made from donations on the education system. Additional pages have 
been created to highlight aims and impact *(also created)* of the donations and a page that links to DonorsChoose to 
connect the user with the charity.

## Development 

- Planning
	- I conceptualised the initial visual look of the website through [Pencil](http://pencil.evolus.vn) wireframes.
	Initially the concept was to created a dashboard for an election-campaign however the concept evolved over time as 
	I felt it personally it was unethical to use charity data for elections and did not feel comfortable to produce a 
	website with this idea in mind, *even in a fictional scenario*. The idea therefore evolved to displaying a dashboard
	of information from a select number of US States to show the impact that donations with the idea of increasing 
	awareness and visibility of the charity DonorsChoose and the good work they do for classrooms, students and teachers. 

- Testing
    - Validation of syntax through [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) and [HTML](https://validator.w3.org) 
	Validators, JavaScript code on [JSHint](jshint.com) and syntax on Python through [LOOK UP THIS](hyperlink)+
	- Used ```CTRL+SHIFT+P``` to reindent tabs to ensure CSS and HTML code is structured cleanly.
	- Checked console for errors in JavaScript and used console.log to print out content for resolution of issues.
	- Used issue tracker on Github and branches for version control.
	- Installed various browsers: Opera, IE, Edge, Firefox, Chrome for testing for cross-compatibility in various 
	platforms and devices: Android, Apple ipad and iphone.

- Implementation
	- For mobile responsiveness and font and image-sizing I referred to best practice discussed on StackOverflow 
	and ensured font-size was 16px = 1em. Initially I had thought of keeping this font for all devices however have 
	decided to alter font sizes for each device upon reflection. I have also included a line-height of 1.25em for easy 
	legibility of paragraphs on mobile devices.

- Reflections 
    - In future I need to keep in mind that *less is more*. My initial concept was too complex and *seemed to grow arms 
    and legs*, from having images, videos, contact forms, donations forms etc. when essentially all that was required is 
    a data dashboard and a few additional pages. 

## Technologies Used
- Dashboard Specific
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for responsive simplistic layouts. 
    - [Crossfilter.js](http://square.github.io/crossfilter): A JavaScript based data manipulation library that enables 
    two way data binding.
    - [DC.js](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js): A JavaScript based wrapper library for D3.js, which makes plotting the 
    charts a lot easier and dc.css for styling directives for dc charts.
    - [D3.js](https://d3js.org): A JavaScript based visualization engine, which will render interactive charts and 
    graphs based on the data.
    - [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org): A Python based  microâ€“framework  used to serve our data from the server 
    to our web based interface.
    - [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org): A Python package, used for running HTTP servers on UNIX based operating systems.
    - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and [mLab](https://mlab.com) for deployment.
    - [Intro.js](https://introjs.com) & Introjs.css providing pop-up tooltip tour of the dashboard.
    - [Keen.js](https://github.com/keen/keen-js): A dashboard template library. Used in conjunction with bootstrap to 
    layout dashboard elements.
    - [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com): NoSQL Database used to convert and present our data in JSON format.
    - [Queue.js](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue): An asynchronous helper library. It waits till data is available from 
    each API before passing on the combined data for processing.

## Additional Technologies Used

- [Github](https://www.github.com) for version control.
