                    DonorsChoose has supported a lot of schools in various US states.
                    Our aim is to increase our reach, so that no student and teacher is disadvantaged from their
                    location. We hope to have equal education for everyone. That each student and teacher is
                    provided with what they need to study, to learn and to teach.
